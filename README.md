# Appscript Automation

This repository serves as a monorepo for various Google Apps Script automation projects. Each project is contained within its own subdirectory and is managed using [`clasp`](https://github.com/google/clasp) for version control.

## 📂 Repository Structure

To install `clasp` globally, run:

```bash
npm install -g @google/clasp
```

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/appscript-automation.git
   cd appscript-automation

## 🛠️ Workflow

### Working on an Existing Project

1. **Navigate to the project folder**
   ```bash
   cd job-application
   ```

2. **Pull latest changes from Google (Optional)**
   If you or someone else made changes directly in the Apps Script editor:
   ```bash
   clasp pull
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   Edit the `.js` files in your preferred code editor.

4. **Push changes to Google**
   Deploy your local changes to the Apps Script project:
   ```bash
   clasp push
   ```
   > **⚠️ Warning:** This overwrites the code on Google's servers with your local files.

### Adding a New Project

To add a new automation script (e.g., `calendar-reminders`):

1. **Create a new folder**
   ```bash
   mkdir calendar-reminders
   cd calendar-reminders
   ```

2. **Initialize the project**
   
   **Option A: Create a new script**
   ```bash
   clasp create --type standalone --title "Calendar Reminders"
   ```

   **Option B: Clone an existing script**
   Find the `Script ID` from your project URL (e.g., `https://script.google.com/d/<SCRIPT_ID>/edit`) and run:
   ```bash
   clasp clone <SCRIPT_ID>
   ```
